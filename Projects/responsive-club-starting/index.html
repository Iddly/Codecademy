        <h2>Thinking of teaching English in Japan? Here's what you need to know...</h2>
        <h2>EFL Industry</h2>
        <p>
          The demand for learning English in Japan is huge. English lessons are now provided in most Junior and High Schools, and many Elementary
          Schools and Kindergartens are starting to offer English classes on a selective basis.
        </p>
        <h2>"Native" English speakers</h2>
        <p>
          People who speak English as their first language are collectively dubbed “Native” speakers in Japan. Since there is a growing expectation
          that instructors of English should be native speakers, native speakers are very much in demand in both the public and private sectors.
        </p>
        <h2>Immigration Issues</h2>
        <p>
          The ever-growing demand for teachers from English-speaking countries has prompted the government to devise a special work visa specifically
          for people traveling to Japan for the purpose of teaching English: the “Specialist in Humanities and International Services” visa.
        </p>
        <h2>Skype Lessons</h2>
        <p>
          Many English schools now offer Skype lessons where teachers can teach English to enthusiastic students from the office. Skype: a peer to
          peer internet telephony network program allows those who have the program installed to speak to each other from anywhere in the world for
          free. For a small charge (depending on the country) Skype to telephone or Skype to mobile phone is possible as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Teaching Children</h2>
        <p>
          Whether because of the overwhelming pressures of a competitive education system, or because it’s widely agreed that a child’s capacity to
          acquire and retain language skills far exceeds that of adults, more and more parents and teachers are introducing children to English
          lessons.
        </p>
        <h2>Teaching Conversation</h2>
        <p>
          English Conversation classes make up the majority of lessons in private English schools. The next section addresses the private “Eikaiwa”
          industry separately, but click HERE to read class descriptions, sample lesson plans and some basic teaching methods.
        </p>
        <h2>Eikaiwa Schools</h2>
        <p>
          All School kids in Japan study English for at least 3 years, and the curriculum focuses principally on correct grammar and direct
          translation of sentences. The “Eikaiwa” or “Conversation Room” industry has grown out of a desire for Japanese people to use the English
          they have studied to learn to communicate in a more meaningful way.
